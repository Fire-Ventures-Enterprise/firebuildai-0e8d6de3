# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in FireBuild.ai and best practices for maintaining security.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- Supabase Auth with Row Level Security (RLS)
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- JWT tokens for API access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Data Protection
- All data encrypted at rest (Supabase)
- TLS/SSL for data in transit
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- No sensitive data in client-side code

### Input Validation
- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies

### Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Referrer-Policy

## Security Checklist

### Development
- [ ] Never commit sensitive data (.env files, API keys)
- [ ] Use environment variables for configuration
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Sanitize data before rendering
- [ ] Use parameterized queries
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Log security events

### Dependencies
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies
- [ ] Run `npm audit` regularly
- [ ] Use Dependabot for automated updates
- [ ] Review security advisories

### API Security
- [ ] Authenticate all API endpoints
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Validate request payloads
- [ ] Use HTTPS only
- [ ] Implement proper CORS policies

### Database Security
- [ ] Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
- [ ] Use least privilege principle
- [ ] Regular backups
- [ ] Audit database access
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive fields

## Incident Response

### If a Security Issue is Found

1. **Do Not** create a public issue
2. **Contact** the security team privately
3. **Document** the issue thoroughly
4. **Wait** for confirmation before disclosure

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledge** - Within 24 hours
2. **Investigate** - Determine impact and scope
3. **Fix** - Develop and test patch
4. **Release** - Deploy fix with security advisory
5. **Disclose** - Coordinate disclosure if needed

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- GitHub security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code quality checks
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing (quarterly)
- Security code review
- Authentication testing
- Authorization testing
- Input validation testing

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- User data export functionality
- Right to deletion
- Privacy policy
- Cookie consent
- Data processing agreements

### Industry Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- PCI DSS (if processing payments)
- SOC 2 (in progress)
