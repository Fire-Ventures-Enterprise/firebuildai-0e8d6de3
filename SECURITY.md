# FireBuild.ai Security Overview

## Our Security Commitment

At FireBuild.ai, we take the security of your data seriously. This document outlines the comprehensive security measures we've implemented to protect your business and customer information.

## üîê Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Defense
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Every database table enforces strict access controls
- **Token-Based Access**: Public portals use cryptographically secure tokens
- **Audit Logging**: All security-relevant events are tracked and monitored
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are protected against abuse

### Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **At Rest**: All data stored in our database is encrypted using AES-256
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Tokens**: High-entropy (128-bit) tokens with optional expiry

#### Access Control
- **Authentication**: Secure session management with JWT tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **MFA Support**: Two-factor authentication available
- **Device Management**: Track and revoke device sessions

## üõ°Ô∏è Infrastructure Security

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS attack blocking
- Rate limiting per endpoint

### Security Headers
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Content-Security-Policy: [Strict CSP rules]
```

### Payment Security
- **PCI Compliance**: We never store credit card data
- **Stripe Integration**: All payments processed through Stripe's secure infrastructure
- **Webhook Verification**: Cryptographic signature verification for all payment webhooks

## üìä Data Privacy
